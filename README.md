# Mail Sending Using Python

Python Script to send a mail with the help of 'smtplib' and 'email' modules. We can extend the same code to send mails to multiple recepients.
This can be done by importing the csv. Defining a new function, inside the function, cut paste the below code.
Then with the help of for loop, we can keep calling the defined function to send mails to each entry in the CSV file.
Please note that I have tested this script for Gmail only. You are free to use this code to enable sending mails via other providers.

Note : If you plan on uploading your script to GitHub or any other location, ensure that you don't mention your sender_mail_id and Application_Password in the file.
If at all you do upload it, those who get access to the repository will be able to send mails using the credentials. 

If you face issues while implementing this code, or sending mails to multiple users, feel free to reach out to me at 'krkolle@gmail.com'
